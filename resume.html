							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>I was born and raised in Z&uuml;rich, Switzerland where I grew up skiing and hiking the Alps. It's a beautiful country so I spend a lot of time in nature with my dogs Lucy and Lily. I don't make it home as often as I would like to, but when I'm there I make sure to get my fill of chocoalte and cheese!</p>

							<h3>Outside of Work</h3>
							<p>I like to explore Boston and look for new places to eat and drink. I also love to cook and will often spend my weekends perfecting a recipe or trying something wildly new. When the weather is bad I enjoy playing video games and working on side projects ranging from small robotics to hobby apps.</p>

						<h2>Current Work</h2>
						<p>I am currently working at Honeycommb; a privatized social network engine for communities looking to connect on a deeper and more intimate level. Working at a startup comes with many different challanges and it has been very interesting to see this company grow. Working as part of a small team has presented me with amazing oppertunities and allowed me to work on some really cool features. Since I started in 2017, I have grown so much as a developer and now lead both the iOS and Android applications.</p>
